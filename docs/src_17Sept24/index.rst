The Risk Explorer Tool
====================================================

Welcome to the homepage of the Oasis Risk Explorer. 

Access the Risk Explorer at `temporary URL <http://54.154.28.86:3838/>`_.

The Oasis Risk Explorer is an educational tool developed by the `Insurance Development Forum <https://www.insdevforum.org/>`_  in partnership with `Oasis <https://oasislmf.org>`_ and `Maximum Information <https://www.maxinfo.io/>`_. 

The Risk Explorer is designed to help people understand some of the data, processes, and concepts of catastrophe risk modelling with a focus on designing parametric insurance. The tool has been built by a team with extensive experience of catastrophe modelling and insurance pricing.  

The step-by-step guided workflow contains options to customise inputs, to help people who are new to this topic learn the effects of different data choices and assumptions on estimated parametric payouts. For example, users can see the effect of using only historical cyclone track data compared with a statistical simulation approach.

This is a free and open-source tool, available under a `BSD-3-Clause license <https://github.com/OasisLMF/RiskExplorer#BSD-3-Clause-1-ov-file>`_. The code is available on `the OasisLMF RiskExplorer GitHub repository <https://github.com/OasisLMF/RiskExplorer>`_. 

The tool provides data and workflows for three hazards: tropical cyclone and drought weather index (both with global coverage), and earthquake (selected locations).

The following sections of this user guide provide more general information, while the hazard-specific sections provide detailed methodology specific to those hazards.
