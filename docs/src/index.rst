The Risk Explorer Tool
====================================================

Welcome to the homepage of the Oasis Risk Explorer. 

The Oasis Risk Explorer is an educational tool developed by the `Insurance Development Forum <https://www.insdevforum.org/>`_  in partnership with `Oasis <https://oasislmf.org>`_ and `Maximum Information <https://www.maximuminformation.com/>`_. 
The Risk Explorer provides an introduction to the different considerations that go into designing and modelling parametric catastrophe insurance covers. It is designed to be transparent, easily accessible and quick to run. 

The tool has been built by a team with extensive experience of catastrophe modelling, insurance pricing and parametric insurance design. It has deliberately been designed to be as simple as possible, while still capturing the key features that determine risk. This document is designed to give full transparency into the chosen methodology and its limitations, as well as providing the user with a guide on how to run the tool. 


This is an open-source tool, and the code is available at `GitHub <https://github.com/OasisLMF/RiskExplorer>`_
