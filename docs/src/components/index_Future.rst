What is going to be included in the model in the future?
============================================================

There are a number of extra features and functionality that will be built into the model throughout its development. Some of the key future improvements to highlight here are:

**Exposure**

* **Allow for exposure upload beyond simple location/area:** Ability for users to upload multiple assets with financial information in the tool.

* **Exposure Analysis Functionality:** As exposure information becomes more detailed, ability for users to break down their assets by typology, category replacement cost and other factors.


**Hazard**

* **Years of Selection:** Ability to vary the timeframe of historical data that feeds the tool. E.g. if the user feels there is a climate impact and would be comfortable using a more recent window.

* **Greater Peril Coverage:** Additional perils to be included such as flood, wildfire, earthquake and convective storm.

* **Greater Data Source Coverage:** Additional data sources beyond IBTrACS e.g. OASIS stochastic sets.

* **Hazard Data Upload Functionality:** Ability to upload custom stochastic event sets directly into the tool.

**Vulnerability**

* **Ability to handle more types of insurance covers beyond simple parametric:** Traditional insurance covers as well as non-typical humanitarian based covers e.g. economic lives affected.

* **Vulnerability Upload Functionality:** Ability to upload custom vulnerability functions directly into the tool.

**Simulation**

* **Ability to handle different calculation methods beyond existing historical sampling simulation method:** Different simulation methods will be required to handle stochastic event sets as well as additional perils where the historical sampling method may not be appropriate.

* **Methodological improvements to the simulation method** including better accounting for land decay and variable RMW by basin.

* **Optimise speed of calculation engine:** Ensure large number of simulations can be easily run.

**Outputs**

* **Build on range of outputs currently available:**  As sophistication of inputs increases, an increased and more detailed number of outputs will be generated.

* **Dynamic Cover Analysis:**  Make it easier to tweak cover design directly in the output tab and directly see the impact on expected payouts across the curve.

**UI**

* **More sophisticated user feedback:** E.g. hover over tooltips, additional validation to prevent users putting in the wrong information, loading bars, direct links to appropriate help sections on each page.
