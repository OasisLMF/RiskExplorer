These pages will provide a step-by-step guide to running the RiskExplorer tool

**What is the Oasis Risk Explorer?**

The Oasis Risk Explorer is a tool developed by the Insurance Development Forum in partnership with Oasis and Maximum Information. The central purpose of this tool is educational, 
serving as an introduction to the different considerations that go into designing and modelling catastrophe insurance covers. The model is currently in its pilot phase and a number
of further features will be added before the full launch in November this year.

The tool aims to guide the users through the different steps required in setting up and modelling a parametric insurance cover. Each of these steps is broken out into separate tabs that form the
the basic building blocks of virtually any catastrophe model. The first three sections require input from the user to define how the insurance cover in question will work and be modelled:

* **Hazard** What type of events (e.g. windstorms/eathquakes etc.) are you modelling and what data should be used to model them?
* **Exposure** Which area are you interested in covering?
* **Vulnerability** What events will your insurance cover pay out based on and how much payout will you receive? 

The next two sections allow the user to run modelling and view output from their modelling:

* **Simulation Engine** Once hazard, exposure and vulnerability are specified this is where you can run probabilistic modelling on your cover
* **Output** This is where you can view the output of the modelling 

**What should this model be used for and what should it not be be used for?**

As mentioned before the main use of this model is as an educational tool.

**What is parametric insurance?**

Paramateric insurance pays out a pre-agreed amount when a certain type of event occurs in a given location or area. The amount paid to the policyholder will often be specified 
in "steps" determined by the magnitude or intensity of the event in question. 

Parametric insurance covers are specifically focused on in the Risk Explorer as they are commonly used in emerging economies. 
They are widely used due to their simplicity and the speed with which pay-outs can be worked out and distributed to policyholders compared to standard insurance covers. 

The example below gives a simplified demonstration of how a cover might work: 

A parametric insurance product is purchased by a local  authority to cover windstorm damage in a town that is prone to typhoons. The local goverment have some
idea of the economic cost of these types of events from previous typhoons that have hit the town in the past. They decide that they want coverage for events that
are at least of category 2 strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale, as recent events have demonstrated that this is generally where the cost of such events starts to become
an issue. They decide based on their budget and their knowledge of previous events to buy the following cover.

Area Covered: 5km radius around the centre of the town
Trigger: Wind speed
Maximum Amount: $10m
Payout Terms:

Wind speed                   Pay-out
154km/h (category 2)         50% of maximum ($5m)
178km/h (category 3)         75% of maximum ($7.5m)
209km/h (category 4)         100% of maximum ($10m)

So in this example, if a wind speed greater than 154km/h but less than 178km/h is recorded within a 5km radius of the town, the local authority would receive $5m in pay-out.
Similarly if a wind speed of say 180km/h was recorded, they would receive a pay-out of $7.5m.
