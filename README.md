# Risk Explorer Online documentation

The docs are built using Sphinx `<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ and Read The Docs theme `<https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.

To add documentation, install Sphinx, make a local copy of the gh-pages branch, and update the following files. Make html, and push the files back to this repo to publish the revisions at https://oasislmf.github.io/RiskExplorer/. 

* docs/src/index.rst (the home page - intended for general information)

* docs/src/index_userGuide.rst (written as an accessible user guide)

* docs/src/index_Technical.rst (for technical documentation)

* docs/src/docs_img/ - add any images (e.g. screenshots of the tool) to this folder



Note: oasislmf.github.io/RiskExplorer/ is public even though the repo is currently private.
